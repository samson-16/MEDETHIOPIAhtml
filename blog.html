        Separation anxiety signals development
        Each child experiences separation anxiety a little differently, but the most common expression is distress in 
        the presence of unfamiliar people, places, or things. It may worsen when a parent or primary caregiver leaves the child.
        
        “Frustrating as it may be in the moment, separation anxiety actually signals key milestones in your child’s development,” 
        Dr. Espinosa-Louissaint says.
        
        First, they’re beginning to realize they’re a separate physical entity from you. 
        They’re also starting to distinguish between the familiar and unfamiliar.
        
        The problem arises when they become anxious with people or places they don’t recognize.
        
        “Children can be clingy, cry often, and not want to let their caregiver out of their sight,” Espinosa-Louissaint says. 
        “That’s because they now understand that you can separate from them, but they don’t yet grasp that you’re going to come back.”

          <h2>Helping an infant or toddler with separation anxiety</h2> <br>
“The earlier you introduce family, friends, and babysitters to your child, the milder their separation anxiety should be,” Espinosa-Louissaint says.

“Infants and toddlers will warm up to new people if they see their caregiver positively engaged with that person,” she says. “It signals that it’s a safe situation.”

Before introducing your infant or toddler to someone new:

wait until your child reaches for the new person
remind the new person to take it slow
make sure your child has eaten recently and had a nap
be reassuring and cheerful
respect your child’s boundaries (i.e., don’t make them hug someone, even if they are a relative)

          <h3>Helping an older child with separation anxiety</h3>
            <p>“Separation anxiety may evolve into shyness or even social anxiety around age 3,” Dr. Espinosa-Louissaint says.
            
            “It’s important for children at all stages of development to learn how to engage socially.
             Those who never grow out of their separation anxiety may need extra encouragement and
              support in preschool or elementary school,” she says.
            
            Try being exceedingly positive with your child. Build their self-confidence by praising 
            their “wins” but also their effort, no matter the outcome.
            
            Encourage them to explore social activities like clubs, sports, and volunteering.
             “They’re great for physical and emotional health,” Espinosa-Louissaint says. 
            “And the more enjoyment they get, the less conscious they’ll be of making new friends.”</p>
